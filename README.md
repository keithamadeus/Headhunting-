I've crafted an application that's basically a GitHub user scavenger hunt, but instead of Easter eggs, you get potential hires. When you first load the page, you're greeted with the profile of one candidate, displaying all their juicy details - name, username, where they're from, their avatar (because who doesn't want to put a face to the code?), their email, GitHub URL, and the company they're with or dreaming of being with. 

Now, if I see a candidate I like, I hit the "+" button, adding them to my 'Potential Candidates' list, and voila, the next candidate slides in like a deck of cards. But if they're not quite the match, I tap the "-" button, moving on without adding them to my collection. 

The twist? If there are no more candidates left to review, I don't leave you hanging; instead, I show a message that's the digital equivalent of a shrug, saying there are no more candidates to sift through.

When you navigate to the 'Potential Candidates' list, it's like opening a treasure chest of GitHub profiles, where all the saved candidates are laid out for you to admire or reconsider. And because life's too short for repetitive work, this list sticks around even if you refresh the page - persistence is key!

But if there's not a single soul in that list, well, I make sure to let you know with another message, this one a bit more like a gentle nudge saying, "Hey, maybe it's time to start saving some candidates."

And that "-" button? It's your way of saying "Next!" without any commitment, just pure browsing pleasure. All this, thanks to the magic of TypeScript ensuring everything works smoothly, with React making the interface as interactive as a game show.
